# Git hooks

Disclaimer: when I say _git hooks_ Iâ€™m talking
about [commiting-workflow
hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#_committing_workflow_hooks).

## What are git hooks?

Git hooks are scripts that automatically run before (or after) you make changes
to a repository. For example, you can automatically run tests, lint checks,
automatic formatting and other niceties that help you push better code to the
project.

## How hooks work

By default, git hooks live in `.git/hooks` inside the repo. For example, to
automatically run a command before committing, simply create a
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` script:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "You're about to commit a change ðŸ‘€"

# Change input to keyboard so user can interact
exec < /dev/tty
read -p "Are you really really sure? (y/n) "
[[ $REPLY == "y" ]] && exit 0 || exit 1
```

This will prompt the user to confirm if they **really really** want to commit
the changes. Menancing, but Iâ€™m not sure if effective.

## Tracking git hooks

The problem is that `.git/hooks` is a private directory, which means hooks will
only be available locally and not for everyone using the repo. Let's change that
and tell git to look for hooks in the `.githooks` directory:
```bash
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Then, simply add `.githooks` to the repo.

## Making all contributors use the hooks

Now everyone has the directory in the repo, but git is looking for the hooks in
the wrong place: the default directory. To use them, each contributor must
manually configure their repo to use `.githooks` as their hooks path. Bummer. 

However, to make life easier for everyone, you can add the config command to
your projectâ€™s setup script. 

For example, if your project has a `package.json` you can add a `prepare`
script:
```bash
"scripts": {
  ...
  "prepare": "git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks"
}
```

This will make git look for hooks in the correct place as soon as they `yarn
install`.

## Useful git hooks

Now that weâ€™ve put everyone in the same page and weâ€™re all using the same hooks,
we can create useful things.

### Example 1: Force everyone to use commitizen when commiting
Not cool, but... When commiting, commitzen will open and help the user form a
conventional commit message. Add to `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Change input to keyboard so user can interact
exec < /dev/tty
# Run commitizen
yarn cz --hook || true
```

### Example 2: Lint commit messages with commitlint
Much saner. If the user tries to commit changes with a non-conventional message,
abort (if they want to, they can use commitzen to help them). Add to
`.githooks/commit-msg`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Run commitlint against current commit
yarn commitlint --edit "${1}"
```

### Example 3: Lint code
When commiting, check files for lint errors with eslint. Add to
`.githooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Lint all jsx and js files
eslint --ext jsx,.js ./
```

### Example 4: Run prettier only on staged files
When commiting, run code formatting only on staged files.  Add to
`.githooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | sed 's| |\\ |g')
[ -z "$STAGED_FILES" ] && exit 0

# Prettify staged files
echo "$STAGED_FILES" | xargs ./node_modules/.bin/prettier --ignore-unknown --write

# Add back the files to staging
echo "$STAGED_FILES" | xargs git add

exit 0
```
